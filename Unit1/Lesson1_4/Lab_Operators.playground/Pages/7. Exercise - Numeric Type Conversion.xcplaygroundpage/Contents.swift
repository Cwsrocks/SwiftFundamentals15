## Exercise - Numeric Type Conversion

 Create an integer constant `x` with a value of 10, and a double constant `y` with a value of 3.2. Create a constant `multipliedAsIntegers` equal to `x` times `y`. Does this compile? If not, fix it by converting your `Double` to an `Int` in the mathematical expression. Print the result.

let x:Int = 10
let y:Double = 32
let multipliedAsIntegers = x * Int(y)
print(multipliedAsIntegers)
//:  Create a constant `multipliedAsDoubles` equal to `x` times `y`, but this time convert the `Int` to a `Double` in the expression. Print the result.
let multipliedAsDoubles = Double(x) * y
print(multipliedAsDoubles)
//:  Are the values of `multipliedAsIntegers` and `multipliedAsDoubles` different? Print a statement to the console explaining why.
print("The values are not different, because they are whole numbers, so the introduction of decimals does not influence them. However, when multiplied as doubles, the result is different, including a vacant decimal place.")
