## App Exercise - Fitness Tracker: Constant or Variable?
 
 >These exercises reinforce Swift concepts in the context of a fitness tracking app.
 
 There are all sorts of things that a fitness tracking app needs to keep track of in order to display the right information to the user. Similar to the last exercise, declare either a constant or a variable for each of the following items, and assign each a sensible value. Be sure to use proper naming conventions.
 
- Name: The user's name
- Age: The user's age
- Number of steps taken today: The number of steps that a user has taken today
- Goal number of steps: The user's goal for number of steps to take each day
- Average heart rate: The user's average heart rate over the last 24 hours

let name = "Paul Conagher"
print("Even though it is possible to change your name, it is unlikely.")
var age = 27
print("Age is defined by change over time. In fact, it is how it is measured.")
var steps = 2957
print("As the user takes steps, the count will change. Daily, it will reset.")
let stepGoal = 10000
print("A prior example in this exercise listed a step goal as a constant.")
var heartRate = 88
print("On any given day, your heart may beat faster or slower.")
/*:
 Now go back and add a line after each constant or variable declaration. On those lines, print a statement explaining why you chose to declare the piece of information as a constant or variable.
